# Most Simple|Stupid Programming language. (MSPL)

### ***Stack - Based programming language "written in Python"***

## Features:
- #### Interpretate code (Run).
- #### Generate graph for the code (.dot).
- #### Compile (Generate) python code (MSPL -> Python).
- #### Lint (Type check) very simple and slow.

## Language features:
- #### Stack implementation (push, pop by operators)
- #### Conditional IFs ([bool_from_stack] if [code] else [code] endif).
- #### Loops WHILE (while [expression] then [code] endif)
- #### Bytes Memory (mbwrite, mbread, mbshowc, mbptr)

## Simple example:
#### `35 // Push 35 in the stack.`
#### `5 // Push 5 in the stack.`
#### `+ // Pop both 35 and 5, and push their sum in the stack.`
#### `show // Pop value from the stack and show it on the screen.`

## For the documentation, read `DOCUMENTATION.MD`
## Or `/examples/README.MD` for examples.
